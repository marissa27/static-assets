# Static Ass..ets

Ever notice as a developer you begin to create the same things over and over with slight variations? Well if you answered no, touche, but that definitely isn't true over here.

This github is to store common things that are utilized in websites using vanilla everything.

## Still In Progress

This project is an ongoing collaboration that if you happen across it and think, "Damn, I have something I always create and I don't see that in here", then you should definitely make a basic version of that and send in a pull request. Or if you are thinking I have no time for that feel free to make an issue.

## Project Goals
* create everything with ARIA
* integrate testing
* keep up with latest CSS trends

### Coming Up!

More assets!
